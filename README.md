# Project Maze
## Advanced Programming course project

This repo contains a python code to generate and solve random mazes using various algorithms.

### TODO Oct. 8th 2019
* Write comments in model.py
* Implement CSV methods for se-/deserializing mazes
* Test se-/deserializing mazes with stats
* Extend file save/load methods to allow for other filenames than maze.json
* Extend file IO to automatically find appropriate filename for saving
* Thoughts: should mazes have an ID or hash value to make them unique so we can save a maze again under the same name

******

Project will include the following concepts:
* Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Model - View - Controller pattern (MVC)
* Use of differente Maze generating and solving algorithms
